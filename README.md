# Momemory
Inspired by George Sperling's sensory memory experiments, this preliminary module's purpose is to demonstrate that so called sensory memory is bound by the amount of stimulus we are able to perceive in a given moment. That is to say, in a single moment we are completely aware of all sensations we're perceiving. Failure to recall all sensory information is due to limited "long-term" capacity (of even a few seconds). Within each moment, we're completely aware. In the upcoming moments, we discard sensory information which we were perceiving.

Sperling found that when asked to recall all 12 letters flashed to participants (for 1/20th of a second) only 3-5 were recalled. So instead of asking participants to recall all 12 letters, he asked only for a single row of letters using a high, medium, or low tone (played fractions of a second after the letters were flashed) to signify which row should be recalled. He found that participants could recall, on average, 3-4 letters from any row, but only one row at a time. Thus, participants could commit to sensory memory 9-12 items. 

The conclusion of the experiment was that though participants could commit 9-12 items to sensory memory,  by the time it came to recalling all of them, most had already faded from memory within a few seconds. 

The module here, Momemory, is an attempt to take Sperling's experiment to the next level. Extending Sperling's partial report procedure, by presenting many letters (arranged in a circle so as to maximize stimulants in the field of vision) and asking to recall only one (random) letter, it should demonstrate that sensory memory is greater than 9-12 items, and is indeed bound only by the amount of stimulus we can percieve, and the temporal resolution of recall time. The finer the temporal resolution, the more we remember from our sensations.

Intuitively, this makes sense - over the period of a year, our memory of sensations is relatively limited. Given a period of only a second, we can remember the past second's sensations almost exactly. 

The goal of this module is to formally demonstrate this and with discrete sensations. In the extreme case, this experiment would go on to suggest that in a single moment (the smallest slice of time possible) we are completely aware of all.

(Momemory is short for momentary memory, regardless the old adage holds true - mo' memory, mo' problems)
