# Momemory
Inspired by George Sperling's [sensory memory experiment](https://psycnet.apa.org/doiLanding?doi=10.1037%2Fh0093759), this preliminary module's purpose is to demonstrate that sensory memory is bound by the amount of stimulus we are able to perceive in a given moment. That is to say, in a single moment we are completely aware of all sensations. Failure to recall all sensory information is due to limited "short-term" capacity (of even a few seconds). Within each moment we have complete awareness. In the upcoming moments we discard sensory information from previous moments probably to make room for incoming information.

## Sperling's partial recall procedure
Sperling found that when asked to recall all 12 letters flashed to participants (in a 3x4 grid for 1/20th of a second) only 3-5 letters were reliably recalled. So instead of asking participants to recall all 12 letters, he asked only for a single row of 4 letters. However, the row was chosen at random.

A high, medium, or low tone was played fractions of a second after the letters were flashed to signify which row should be recalled. He found that participants could recall, on average, 3-4 letters from any row but only one row at a time. Thus, participants could commit to sensory memory 9-12 items. 

The conclusion of the experiment was that though participants could commit 9-12 items to sensory memory,  by the time it came to recalling them all most had already faded from sensory memory within those few seconds. 

## Extending on Sperling's partial recall procedure
The module here, Momemory, is an attempt to take Sperling's experiment to the next level. 

Extending Sperling's partial report procedure by presenting more letters (arranged in a circle so as to maximize stimulants in the field of vision) and asking to recall only one (random) letter, it should demonstrate that sensory memory is greater than 12 items, and is indeed bound only by the amount of stimulus we can percieve and the delay between presentation and recall. This would be demonstrated by trials consistently showing that we are able to recall any of the letters from a circle of 20.

Intuitively, this makes sense - over the period of a year, our memory of sensations is relatively limited. Given a period of only a second, we can remember the past second's sensations almost exactly. 

The goal of this module is to formally demonstrate this and with discrete sensations. In the extreme case, this experiment would go on to suggest that in a single moment (the smallest slice of time possible) we are completely aware of all.

## Notes
_Click anywhere to start a new trial. Look at the centre of the circle and you should be able to instantly tell which letter was behind the green blocker.
_Number of letters and spacing can be tweaked in the upper left corner of the screen.
_(Momemory is short for "momentary memory", regardless the old adage holds true - mo' memory, mo' problems)_
