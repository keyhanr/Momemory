# Momemory
Inspired by George Sperling's sensory memory experiments, this preliminary module's purpose is to demonstrate that so called sensory memory at any given moment is bound by the amount of stimulus we are able to perceive at a time.

This is demonstarted by showing an arbitrary amount of letters, then covering one after a breif delay. The user will find that they remember the letter that is being covered. The user simply needs to focus on the center of the circle, not even bothering to memorize the letters on the perimeter.

(Momemory is short for momentary memory, regardless the old adage holds true - Momemory, mo' problems)
